### Python File Mover: The Ultimate Solution to Avoiding File Management
### Version 0.4.0.0
[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)


Ever open your downloads folder—or any other folder on your computer—and immediately feel your soul start to shrivel at the thought of sorting through it? Well, now you don’t have to!

**Introducing Python File Mover** — the app that solves the **grueling** task of choosing which files to delete. Because let’s face it, we’ve all spent way too many hours pretending to care about files like:

- **Document_4_final_draft_FINAL_v2.pdf**

With *Python File Mover*, you can just… **not**. It does all the heavy lifting for you, so you can go back to the important work of binge-watching Netflix without the burden of an organized file system.

> **It’s the automation we never knew we needed, but absolutely deserve.**




# Features
- Move files from Directory A to Directory B with only a few commands.
- Move entire folders from Directory A to Directory B.

# How to Download

***Note: Currently Python File Mover is only compatible on Windows devices***
Requirements: You will need to have GIT and PIP installed on your computer for our installation guide.
- Step 1: Clone the latest codebase from your github fork. Please clone from the 'main' branch for our stable versions. | Git tutorial: https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ ✨
- Step 2: Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` | PIP tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp✨
- Step 3: Run `python main.py` in the project directory and the project is now ready for use. ✨


Development Build(Branch: LatestBuild) :
LatestBuild is our development branch and considered unstable as many features and refactoring are in progress. However, if you wish to contribute, we recommend the LatestBuild branch since your pull requests will need to be sent to LatestBuild prior to our main branch releases that are found in our changelog and considered stable.



# Tutorial
 You will then be led to our very intuitive interactive mode! From the interactive mode, you can do the following
- ✨ Move large amounts of folders from Directory A to Directory B: `--move-files`
- ✨ Move large amounts of files from Directory A to Directory B: `--move-folders`


Our program is designed to be straightforward—because who really wants to deal with complicated software? The moment you type python main.py, our interactive mode kicks in, guiding you through the entire process step-by-step. No need to think or waste time reading documentation—just follow the prompts and you’ll be moving files in seconds.

Want to sort and move files by extension? Just run the --move-files command, and voilà, we’ll take care of transferring your files from one directory to another. Plus, with our handy GUI dashboard, you don’t have to memorize the paths to your directories. Just select them from a list and let the program handle the rest. No more guessing if “C:\Users\You\Documents\Folder_123” is where your files are. It’s all right there, just a click away.

Need to move entire folders? Run the --move-folders command, and with just a couple of clicks, you can transfer entire folders—and even folders within folders—without breaking a sweat. Our intuitive GUI makes it easy to select your source and destination directories, and once you’re ready, just type --begin, and let the program do the work for you. It’s like having a personal assistant, but for your files.

# Contribute
A sincere thank you to all the unexpected contributors to this project. Honestly, when we started this, we figured it would be just a small, quiet corner of the internet, full of us staring at code and wondering if anyone would ever care. But here we are—people actually contributed!

It doesn’t matter if you’re the brave soul who fixed a single typo in our README or the hero who submitted code that made the program actually work (we didn’t think anyone would bother). Every little change, no matter how small, has made this project what it is today. That’s the beauty of open-source: apparently, people care more about making things better than we thought possible.

So, once again, thank you to everyone who made the miracle of this project a reality. Without your contributions, we'd still be stuck with that one feature that barely worked. Seriously, you’re the reason this exists at all.

## How to contribute? 
Unfortunately, I have moved on from this project as the maintainer and archieved the project on November 23rd 2024. However, the codebase lives on in the public domain and may be forked and actively worked on and you can design it or improve it however you wish in your own fork.
