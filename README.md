## Version 0.3.0 full version is coming soon! We have migrated to a demo version while I finish up the last features for Version 0.3.0 - Full Relase. Version 0.2.5 has been placed in legacy.py for usage. 

## Features
- Move files from Directory A to Directory B based on extension type.
## Installation
The core of our project is a rather simple python script.
- Step 1: Install Python 3+
- Step 2: Ensure you have the following dependencies installed(: os, shutil, typer, time, tkinter)
- Step 3: Move the files into a directory of your choice.
- Step 4: Load into the directory by typing 'cd /directory/etc' in your command line.
- Step 5: Run python main.py to run the Version 0.3.0 Demo.
