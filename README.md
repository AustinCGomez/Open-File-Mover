#### Note: Python File Mover has been arhicved and active production by the maintainer has concluded at this time. A cross-platform(Unix and Windows) spin-off program named 'CleanUpMyDownloads' will pick off where Python File Mover left off at but with a much more improved architecture. Please check it out at https://github.com/AustinCGomez/CleanUpMyDownloads

# Features
- Move files from Directory A to Directory B with only a few commands.
- Move entire folders from Directory A to Directory B.

# How to Download

***Note: Currently Python File Mover is only compatible on Windows devices***
Requirements: You will need to have GIT and PIP installed on your computer for our installation guide.
- Step 1: Clone the latest codebase from your github fork. Please clone from the 'main' branch for our stable versions. | Git tutorial: https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ ✨
- Step 2: Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` | PIP tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp✨
- Step 3: Run `python main.py` in the project directory and the project is now ready for use. ✨

# Tutorial
 You will then be led to our very intuitive interactive mode! From the interactive mode, you can do the following
- ✨ Move large amounts of folders from Directory A to Directory B: `--move-files`
- ✨ Move large amounts of files from Directory A to Directory B: `--move-folders`


Our program is designed to be straightforward—because who really wants to deal with complicated software? The moment you type python main.py, our interactive mode kicks in, guiding you through the entire process step-by-step. No need to think or waste time reading documentation—just follow the prompts and you’ll be moving files in seconds.

Want to sort and move files by extension? Just run the --move-files command, and voilà, we’ll take care of transferring your files from one directory to another. Plus, with our handy GUI dashboard, you don’t have to memorize the paths to your directories. Just select them from a list and let the program handle the rest. No more guessing if “C:\Users\You\Documents\Folder_123” is where your files are. It’s all right there, just a click away.

Need to move entire folders? Run the --move-folders command, and with just a couple of clicks, you can transfer entire folders—and even folders within folders—without breaking a sweat. Our intuitive GUI makes it easy to select your source and destination directories, and once you’re ready, just type --begin, and let the program do the work for you. It’s like having a personal assistant, but for your files.
