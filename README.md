If you submit any code or documentation then your name will be placed here forever to immortalize your contributions to this project. We appreciate any and all help that we can get in regards to this project and we are thankful for each and every contributer.

### Testing before pull request
We have a main_test.py file that uses PyTest(https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/). Major enhancements must either use main_test.py or a seperate Pytest file to test the functionality and have it passing at the time of your pull request. The Project Maintainer will likely perform a few additional tests if needed before your code is added to the code base. NOTE: Small fixes do not require major testing and neither does documentation.
